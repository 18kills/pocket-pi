# pocket-pi
To be used with a raspberry pi zero
This is a work in progress

When you run setup.py you will be asked to enter a email address and password for that email. 

What this program does(after setup.py is run) is that when you pi boots PocketPi will be run.
If when the pi boots the pi connects to wifi then, an email will be sent to the email that you entered the info for during the setup.py.
This email will contain the network adapter that is connect to the internet, the ip address of that network adapter, the essid of the wifi that adapter is connected to, and if ssh is running
